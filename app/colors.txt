Zespri Kiwifruit, the world leader in premium quality kiwifruit, announces its 2016 season with distribution of SunGold, Green and Organic varietals across North America. Demand for Zespri continues to climb as consumers discover the delicious and superior eating experience of Zespri Kiwifruit. The reason behind the superior eating experience is Zespri's comprehensive quality system, which is used in every stage of the production process and is the basis for all Zespri Kiwifruit growers. Zespri is a grower-owned company. Read more about the 2016 Zespri Kiwifruit season here.

Zespri SunGold is one of the fastest growing new fruits globally. SunGold has a smooth, hairless skin and juicy, yellow flesh. Zespri&#169; SunGold is sweeter than a green kiwifruit, it's refreshing, and has a tropical-sweet taste. A serving of Zespri SunGold has three times more vitamin C than an orange and as much potassium as a banana. The USDA Nutrient Database Release 28 has been updated to include SunGold. Zespri SunGold is a natural cross between gold varietals of kiwifruit - all Zespri kiwifruit is non-GMO.

Zespri conducted research on its packaging and will unveil a new look this season! The new packaging features the product image as the main focus along with the taste profile message (SunGold= refreshing, tropical-sweet taste; Green= refreshing, tangy-sweet taste). The usage message "Cut, Scoop & Enjoy," will also appear on pack to help remind consumers that kiwifruit is a delicious and refreshing snack that is convenient and easy-to-eat with a spoon!

In mid-April, 150 attendees, including researchers and academics representing 16 countries, gathered in Tauranga, New Zealand to discuss the latest research on kiwifruit. The 1st International Symposium on Kiwifruit and Health was hosted by the Riddet Institute - one of New Zealand's National Centers of Research Excellence - and sponsored by Zespri International. Digestive health and the microbiome were hot topics and researchers discussed the prebiotic properties of both green andSunGold kiwifruit.Preliminary findings from a multi-country clinical trial currently underway indicate a daily serving of green kiwifruit helps relieve constipation and also optimizes transit time (measured by ìSmartPillî technology - like a FitBit for gut health research). These preliminary findings meet the FDA criteria for being a clinically effective approach. Another preliminary study indicated that the fiber in green and SunGold kiwifruit behaves differently than other commonly consumed sources of fiber at breakfast (e.g., apples, wheat bran). The new research shows that - because of kiwifruit's high capacity for holding water, which swells and thickens in the stomach - eating kiwifruit with breakfast significantly slows and reduces the uptake of sugars in the blood stream. Learn more about the preliminary research presented at the Symposium here.
